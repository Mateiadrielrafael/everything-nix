# Nixos-config

My first nixos-config! A lot of stuff is taken from [this config](https://github.com/Brettm12345/nixos-config).

Just simlink this in `/etc/nixos/configuration` and import it in `configuration.nix`. This config __does not__ do anything related to the hardware config, so keep that imported as well.

Stuff todo:
- setup zsh
- setup a way to save my vsc config
- look into xmonad
- setup other langs I use like f# and haskell
